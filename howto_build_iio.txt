Go to the "gnuradio" folder, then
  mkdir build/
  cd build/

Configure gnuradio by typing
  ccmake ..

To build and install the whole project:
  make
  sudo make install

To build only the IIO blocks:
  make -C gr-iio
  sudo make -C gr-iio install

If you wish to install the IIO blocks for a version of gnuradio installed with
a package from the distribution, you have to install them in /usr. For this,
the gnuradio tree must be configured to install in /usr:
  ccmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
